# Nandgame-Assembler
This is a CLI utility to compile Nandgame assembly code into machine code.

There are many arguments that change the behaviour of the program.

Stack operations no not currently work, only stuff up Level: Software>Display currently work, or at least should.

Use ngassmbl.exe --help for more options

This program is written in C# on Windows for Windows, and this time I am unable to compile for other hardware and operating systems.
