# Nandgame-Assembler
This is a CLI utility to compile Nandgame assembly code into machine code.

There are many arguments that change the behaviour of the program.

Use ngassmbl.exe --help for more options

This program is written in C# on Windows for Windows, and this time I am unable to compile for other hardware and operating systems.
